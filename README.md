# llm-sast-scanner

A general-purpose **Static Application Security Testing (SAST) skill** for LLM-based code vulnerability analysis. It is loaded by AI coding agents (Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Cursor, and other agent runtimes) to perform structured **source → sink taint analysis** across **77 vulnerability classes** (including the OWASP LLM Top 10 for AI/agent apps), with a Judge verification stage, an optional adversarial impact pass, and a parallel multi-agent orchestration mode for whole-repo audits.

---

## What's in this repo

| Component | What it is |
|-----------|-----------|
| **`llm-sast-scanner/`** | The core skill — a 7-step detection workflow + Judge verification + adversarial validation, backed by 77 vulnerability reference knowledge bases. |
| **`llm-sast-scanner-full-scan-loop/`** | A wrapper skill for an exhaustive, convergence-driven, line-by-line audit of an entire repository. Runs one subagent per vulnerability lens in parallel (or single-context), guarantees 100% line coverage, and writes a timestamped report. |
| **`AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`** | The repo-level orchestrator playbook. Drives the parallel lens fan-out and report consolidation. `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to `AGENTS.md`. |
| **`.claude/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`** | Per-runtime skill discovery directories. Both are **symlinks to the single canonical skill source** at the repo root, so there is exactly one copy of every skill file and the two runtimes can never drift apart. |

---

## What it does

The core skill gives an agent a structured, evidence-based workflow for finding security vulnerabilities in source code:

1. **Understand scope** — target, languages/frameworks, and goal (quick scan, deep audit, single class, full report)
2. **Load references** — pull in only the vulnerability knowledge bases that match the stack in use
3. **Trace taint** — read each file once and evaluate every loaded lens: sources → data flow → sinks → sanitizers
4. **Business logic & auth analysis** — missing authZ, IDOR, broken state machines, race conditions, shared-state cross-user leaks
5. **Judge** — an adversarial second opinion re-verifies every candidate (reachability / sanitization / exploitability) to eliminate false positives
6. **Adversarial impact validation** *(optional, via `adv=`)* — stress-test surviving findings for real-world exploitability
7. **Report** — actionable findings with severity, exact file path + line number, evidence, and concrete remediation

### Languages & ecosystems

- **Application languages:** Java, Python, JavaScript / TypeScript, PHP, C# / .NET, Go, Ruby, C / C++, Kotlin, Swift, Objective-C, Rust
- **Smart contracts:** Solidity / EVM
- **Infrastructure, config & markup:** Terraform / HCL, Kubernetes & CI/CD YAML, Dockerfile, XML, SQL, HTML

Java, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, PHP, and C#/.NET have the deepest, dedicated source-detection rule sets; the remaining languages are covered with vulnerable-vs-secure detection patterns across the relevant vulnerability classes.

---

## Installation

Clone the repo, then copy **both** skill directories into the skills folder for your agent runtime. Copy the real top-level directories (not the `.claude`/`.agents` symlinks).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anthropic-lab/llm-sast-scanner.git
cd llm-sast-scanner

# Claude Code
cp -R llm-sast-scanner llm-sast-scanner-full-scan-loop ~/.claude/skills/

# OpenAI Codex / Cursor / other agent runtimes
cp -R llm-sast-scanner llm-sast-scanner-full-scan-loop ~/.agents/skills/
```

To use the parallel orchestrator, also place `AGENTS.md` (and/or `CLAUDE.md`) at the root of the project you want to scan, or point your agent at it.

---

## Usage

### Single skill — targeted or scoped scan

Invoke the core skill on a file, directory, or whole repo:

```
llm-sast-scanner [adv=critical,high,medium]
```

- Without arguments it runs Steps 1–5 and 7 (no adversarial pass).
- `adv=` selects which severities go through **Step 6: Adversarial Impact Validation** (case-insensitive, comma-separated; valid values: `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`, `info`).

| Invocation | Adversarial validation applied to |
|------------|-----------------------------------|
| `llm-sast-scanner` | none — Step 6 skipped |
| `llm-sast-scanner adv=critical` | Critical only |
| `llm-sast-scanner adv=critical,high` | Critical + High |
| `llm-sast-scanner adv=critical,high,medium` | Critical + High + Medium |

### Exhaustive convergence audit — whole repository

```
llm-sast-scanner-full-scan-loop <dir> [mode=parallel|single] [adv=critical,high,medium]
```

- `<dir>` — repository/directory to audit (defaults to the current directory).
- `mode=parallel` *(default)* — dispatches **one subagent per vulnerability lens**; each runs the convergence loop (Steps 1–5) in its own context until it stops finding new bugs, with a deterministic **scope manifest** ensuring 100% line coverage. A consolidation subagent then merges + de-duplicates findings, runs the adversarial pass once, and writes the report.
- `mode=single` — runs the whole convergence loop in one context (strongest convergence/coverage guarantee; one context owns the ledger + coverage map).
- Output: a timestamped `sast_report-<timestamp>.md`.

### Parallel multi-agent orchestration (`AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`)

The orchestrator playbook coordinates a full assessment and writes everything to a `sast/` folder (re-runnable — steps whose output already exists are skipped):

1. **Codebase analysis & threat modeling** → `sast/architecture.md`
2. **Vulnerability detection (parallel)** — one subagent per lens, each writing `sast/<lens>-results.md`
3. **Report generation** — consolidates and de-duplicates into `sast/final-report.md`

The work is split across six vulnerability lenses, each running in an isolated context:

| Lens | Vulnerability classes |
|------|-----------------------|
| **injection** | SQLi, XSS, client-side prototype pollution, SSTI, NoSQLi, GraphQL, XXE, RCE/command injection, expression-language, LDAP, XPath/XQuery, CSV/formula, log injection, prompt injection |
| **access-auth** | IDOR, privilege escalation / missing auth (BFLA), authentication & JWT, default credentials, brute force, business logic, HTTP method tampering, verification code abuse, session fixation, mass assignment |
| **crypto-data** | weak crypto/hash, information disclosure, insecure cookie, trust boundary, shared-client cache/dedup cross-user leak, cleartext transmission, certificate/TLS validation |
| **server-side** | SSRF, path traversal/LFI/RFI, client-side path traversal, server-side prototype pollution, insecure deserialization, arbitrary file upload, JNDI injection, race conditions, insecure temp file, file permissions |
| **protocol-infra** | CSRF, open redirect, request smuggling/desync, response splitting, host header poisoning, CORS misconfiguration, clickjacking, web cache deception, DoS, regex injection/ReDoS, CVE patterns |
| **hardening-platform** | output encoding, format string, ASP.NET misconfiguration, hardcoded/backdoor code, dependency confusion, PHP security, mobile security |

> **Skill resolution:** subagents invoke skills by name. Each runtime loads them from its own directory — Claude Code from `.claude/skills/`, Codex/Cursor/other agents from `.agents/skills/`. Both directories symlink to the same canonical source, so the two runtimes always run identical skill content.

---

## Workflow detail

The core skill (`llm-sast-scanner/SKILL.md`) defines the full protocol:

- **Read-once discipline** — each source file is read once and evaluated against every loaded lens, keeping total read cost ~1× the codebase regardless of how many classes are in scope.
- **Sources / sinks / sanitizers** — every reference documents per-language entry points, dangerous sinks, and the barriers that neutralize them; recognized barriers are required before ruling a finding SAFE.
- **Judge verdicts** — `CONFIRMED`, `LIKELY`, `NEEDS CONTEXT`, or `FALSE POSITIVE`. Only `CONFIRMED`/`LIKELY` are reported; declaring a false positive requires citing the exact protecting line.
- **False-positive guardrails** — explicit rules for demo/example code, non-default config, internal-only services, protocol-required SSRF, bounded DoS, trusted admin roles, and more.
- **Adversarial verdicts** — `STANDING`, `DOWNGRADED`, `DISPUTED`, or `WITHDRAWN`, applied to finalize severity.

### Severity model

| Severity | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Critical** | Direct RCE, authentication bypass, unauthenticated data exposure |
| **High** | SQLi, SSRF, IDOR with sensitive data, stored XSS, privilege escalation |
| **Medium** | Reflected XSS, CSRF, path traversal, insecure deserialization |
| **Low** | Information disclosure, open redirect, weak crypto, insecure cookie |
| **Info** | Missing security headers, verbose errors, defense-in-depth gaps |

Exploitation that requires authentication, non-default config, chaining, or admin/internal-only access is downgraded one level from the class default.

## Advanced usage tips

- **Precompute the call graph before scanning** — improves cross-function reasoning and reduces missed paths
- **Run 2+ scanning rounds** — increases recall and stabilizes findings via iterative refinement
- **Enforce per-finding validation** — the Judge + adversarial passes significantly cut false positives
- **Use the full-scan-loop for whole-repo audits** — it guarantees 100% line coverage against a deterministic scope manifest
